### User Authentication Service

In the industry, it is generally recommended to use established modules or frameworks for authentication (e.g., Flask-User for Python-Flask) rather than implementing your own. However, for learning purposes, we will walk through each step of building an authentication system to understand the underlying mechanisms by doing it ourselves.

### Key Points:
- **Industry Practice**: Use established modules or frameworks for authentication.
- **Learning Objective**: Understand the authentication mechanism by building it step-by-step.
- **Example Framework**: Flask-User for Python-Flask.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **User Registration**: Create a user registration form and process.
2. **Password Hashing**: Securely hash and store user passwords.
3. **User Login**: Implement user login functionality with session management.
4. **Session Management**: Manage user sessions and maintain authentication state.
5. **Access Control**: Restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user authentication status.

By following these steps, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how authentication systems work and how to implement them securely.
